## 🔧 How It Works on Railway

### Build Process:
1. Railway detects Python + Node.js project
2. Installs Python dependencies (requirements.txt)
3. Installs Node.js dependencies (web_app/package.json)
4. Builds React frontend (`npm run build`)
5. Output goes to `web_app/dist/`

### Runtime:
1. FastAPI starts with `uvicorn main:app`
2. Serves API endpoints at `/api/*`
3. Serves WebSocket at `/ws/*`
4. Serves frontend static files from `web_app/dist/`
5. All on same domain (no CORS issues!)

### URLs:
- **Frontend**: https://your-app.up.railway.app
- **API**: https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/*
- **WebSocket**: wss://your-app.up.railway.app/ws/*

---

## 🌍 Production Features

### Automatic HTTPS
- Railway provides free SSL certificates
- WebSocket automatically upgrades to WSS
- Secure connections

### Environment Variables
- API keys stored securely in Railway
- Not in code or git
- Accessible via Railway dashboard

### Logging
- All logs visible in Railway dashboard
- Real-time log streaming
- Searchable and filterable

### Auto-Deploy
- Push to GitHub
- Railway automatically rebuilds and deploys
- Zero downtime deployments

---

## 📊 File Sizes

```
main.py              ~18 KB  (Production entry point)
app.py               ~45 KB  (Core processing logic)
prompt.txt           ~5 KB   (AI prompt)
requirements.txt     ~1 KB   (Dependencies)
web_app/             ~500 KB (Frontend source)
web_app/dist/        ~2 MB   (Built frontend - created during build)
```

Total deployment size: ~3 MB (very efficient!)

---

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- ✅ API keys in environment variables (not in code)
- ✅ .gitignore prevents committing secrets
- ✅ CORS configured for production
- ✅ Input validation on file uploads
- ✅ File type restrictions
- ✅ Size limits enforced
- ✅ Error handling throughout
- ✅ HTTPS enforced by Railway

---

## 🎨 Production Configuration

### Backend (main.py)
- Serves both API and frontend
- Uses Railway's PORT environment variable
- Handles WebSocket connections
- Serves static files from web_app/dist/
- Full error handling
- Logging enabled

### Frontend (React)
- Built for production (optimized, minified)
- Relative URLs for API calls
- WebSocket auto-detects protocol (ws/wss)
- Dark mode with persistence
- Mobile responsive
- Professional Sky Blue theme

---

## ⚡ Performance

### Build Time:
- Python dependencies: ~2 minutes
- Node dependencies: ~1 minute
- Frontend build: ~30 seconds
- **Total: ~4 minutes** on Railway

### Runtime Performance:
- FastAPI: Very fast async handling
- React: Optimized production build
- WebSocket: Real-time updates
- Material UI: Lazy loaded components

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### File Storage
- Railway has **ephemeral filesystem**
- Uploaded videos are deleted on restart
- For production with many users, add persistent storage:
  - AWS S3
  - Cloudinary
  - Railway Volume (persistent storage addon)

### Database
- Current version uses in-memory job storage
- Jobs are lost on restart
- For production, add:
  - PostgreSQL
  - MongoDB
  - Redis

### Scaling
- Current setup handles moderate traffic
- For high traffic, add:
  - Database for job persistence
  - Cloud storage for videos
  - Queue system for processing
